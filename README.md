1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial company that needed stronger software security. They wanted to protect financial data, ensure secure communication, and prevent unauthorized access.

2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I successfully implemented AES encryption, SHA-256 for integrity, and HTTPS for secure communication. Secure coding prevents cyber threats, protects sensitive data, and ensures regulatory compliance, helping businesses maintain trust and security.

3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Running a dependency-check was helpful in identifying outdated or insecure components and ensuring the refactored code met security standards.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I used AES encryption, SHA-256 verification, and SSL certificates for HTTPS. In the future, I would use penetration testing, static analysis tools, and continuous monitoring.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I performed functional testing and ran a dependency-check to verify security and ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Java Keytool for SSL certificates, AES and SHA-256 for security, dependency-check for vulnerability scanning, and functional testing for validation.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would showcase my implementation of encryption, secure communication, and vulnerability testing, along with test results and secure coding practices.
